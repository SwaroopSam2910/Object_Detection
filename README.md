# Poker Card Class Classifier
The Poker Card Class Classifier is an object detection project developed using YOLOv5, tailored to identify and classify poker cards. This model is trained specifically to detect different poker card types, accurately recognizing them in various orientations and lighting conditions. It main purpose is to identify which rank is your set 5 cards is and identify the winner. There are total 10 ranks on basis of which a winner is decided.

The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset of poker cards, ensuring a high degree of accuracy. You can access the dataset used for training using link "https://universe.roboflow.com/augmented-startups/playing-cards-ow27d/dataset/4". 

The final trained model is available for download "https://drive.google.com/file/d/18IBoso-IBLAL1T3mJYRJfOQ1lcg3XvRk/view?usp=drive_link", allowing you to integrate or test it in your own projects.You can also train your model with your own dataset.

Once set up, the Poker Card Class Classifier is straightforward to use: simply provide an image or video feed, and the model will detect and label poker cards within the frame. With the power of YOLOv5, this project delivers efficient and effective object detection specifically crafted for poker cards.
